C++ codding Guidlines
=====================

	this are C++ codding guidlines that should be followed while adding c++ code to the project

pointer
-------

	* No raw pointer
	* pointer should always be wrapped inside Memory::Owned or used as reference
	* Memory::Unowned should only be used for interface with other library

Exception
---------

	* Exception Type are always in majuscule
	* All exception should inherit from 'Exception' (from Logger module)
	* All exception should be written inside "includes/utils/excpetion_defs.h"

Naming
------

	* Snake_Case for function and class
	* snake_case for variable
	* SNAKE_CASE for constant and enum or exception

comments
--------

	documentation about the function shoudld be written using

	.. code-block:: cpp

		///////////////
		/// @brief :
		/// @param :
		/// @return:
		...

	this is mainly like the doxygene style documentation to identify parameters

spacing
-------

	Inside cpp and h add two blank line before begining the first implementation

includes
--------

	Always group and comment includes inside the cpp and header file, you may use the last folder level to group them together

	.. code-block:: cpp

		// STD
		#include <array>

		// Coordinate
		#include "includes/coordinate/planar_coordiante.h"

		// Projector
		#include "includes/coordinate/Projector/base.h"

Indentation
-----------

	Base indentation should be made with tabulation
	stylistic indentation should use space
