DCEL
====

Here are the thre main datastructure that Aim to describe DCEL architecture.


Vertex
------

Vertex are simply a position in space


Helf_Edge
---------

since vertex are doubly connected between each other and that the graph is connected with face. Half edge are connected to vertices and Face.


Face
----

Face are a collection of half edge that creat a ring
